	<h3>My fears</h3>
	<p> Older bloks the older version control systems would store differences at file level  because they think of data as a collection of many individual items such as file and documents,that means if you make any changes at the file level those will be recorded say in version1 of a project there was a change made to say  FileA  and this was released the next change was in version4 of the same project  for the same fileA ...now a regular version control will recored all this at the file level ....but a project is not just one file its a collection of many just imagine the amount of confusion if these files were renamed or split or mergerd.</p>

	<p>But not to worry.... this exaclty where git yeah me "i am different" i will keep snapshots of  whole project in my very own folder called .git.Its formally called the .git repository.You see i think of data as a whole hence you would have a stream of snapshots of your whole project with the changes that you have made.Every single change will be recorded nothing will be missed i assure you that but it will be recorded as a whole.so say no to differences and yes to sanpshots.</p>

	<p>.And cherry on icecream i am distributed not centralised so....dont fight each one of you will have a copy me(cause i have your project hehe).Copy of me means a copy of your project dummy.</p>
