	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p> Hi, I am git.</p>
	Welcome to my world, I am simple, but people don't get me. I created this happy version of me, so that people can know me for who I am, the way I see me rather than what people have overcomplicated me into. The table of contents should give you a cool idea of who I am, though my story is still under work, this is the trailer of the movie that will follow.
