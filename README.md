# All About git

I tried learning git a few months ago, went through the documentation and it made me feel like a "git". Over the last few weeks I took a dig at coming up with an alternative documentation. Of course, it still leaves a lot to be desired, but am working on it.

License and gitignore are still missing here and someday soon I will add them too.
